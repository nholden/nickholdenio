    <p>
      During the day, I use words and multimedia to tell compelling stories for middle and high school programs at MIT. In early 2014, I took an online course that reignited my interest in programming, and I've been hooked ever since. Now, I spend a whole lot of my free time learning about technologies to build useful web applications and automate tedious processes.
